# The task "pickup the red bottle and pour water in the black cup" involves the following stages:
# 1. Align end-effector: Decide the orientation of the end-effector for picking up the bottle.
# 2. Grasp red bottle: Align the end-effector with the red bottle.
# 3. Align bottle with cup: Position the bottle above the cup.
# 4. Pour water: Tilt the bottle to pour water into the cup.
